# EPQ Mock Sign-up Form
Psychology experiment to investigate how willing participants are to hand over personal data.

This will be used to provide evidence to answer my EPQ question "Are we willing to sacrifice privacy for the sake of efficiency?" as participants will be instructed to fill in as much of the form as they feel comfortable doing, but filling out more of the form will make for a more efficient login process in the future.

After the experiment a full debrief will be carried out.
